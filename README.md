## Projects

### Football Database

**Description:** In this project, a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/technika148/football-database/data) was utilized, containing information across 6 tables and 356,500 rows related to football in the top five European leagues between 2014 and 2020. The initial phase of the work took place in SQL Server Management Studio, where data cleaning and transformation were carried out. After the data preparation was completed, a detailed analysis of the tables was conducted. Finally, a dashboard was created using Power BI.

**Presentation:** [Football Dashboard.pdf](https://github.com/juanmarquina1/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Football%20Dashboard%20Estatico.pdf) / [Football Dashboard.pbix](https://github.com/juanmarquina1/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Football%20Dashboard.pbix)

**Results:** Detailed tables of league and season standings were created, accompanied by the calculation of averages for goals and assists per match for each player. This process provided valuable insights into individual and team performance. Additionally, a comparison was made between actual data and projections, visually showing the accuracy of predictions on a team-by-team basis.


### Northwind Database

**Description:** In this project, the decision was made to utilize the Northwind database, an example developed by Microsoft. This database contains information on the sales of a fictional company called "Northwind Traders," engaged in the import and export of specialty foods worldwide. The project was executed in Power BI, involving data cleaning and transformation, along with the implementation of measures for the subsequent creation of the dashboard.

**Analysis:** [Northwind Análisis](https://github.com/juanmarquina1/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Northwind%20-%20Analysis.pdf)

**Presentation:** [Northwind Dashboard.pdf](https://github.com/juanmarquina1/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Northwind%20Dashboard%20Est%C3%A1tico.pdf) / [Northwind Dashboard.pbix](https://github.com/juanmarquina1/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Northwind%20Dashboard.pbix)

**Results:** Se ha alcanzado una comprensión de múltiples aspectos fundamentales de la base de datos, abarcando desde una perspectiva global de ingresos y tiempos de transporte hasta un análisis detallado de productos, categorías, empleados, clientes y envíos.
